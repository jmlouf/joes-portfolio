# Joe's Portfolio

## Description

Building an online portfolio using HTML and CSS is a great way to showcase my skills, get real-world coding practice, and have an impressive deliverable to highlight when applying for jobs or internships. Here are some key reasons why creating a portfolio site is valuable:

- Allows practice of web design principles - An online portfolio gives experience with web design best practices like responsive layouts and accessible markup.

- Develops attention to detail - Crafting a polished, professional portfolio requires strong attention to detail in coding, content, and overall user experience.

- Acts as a showcase for future employers - A live portfolio site provides a demonstrable example of my abilities that can be shared with companies during the hiring process.

- Provides an opportunity for feedback - I can collect user feedback through my portfolio to identify strengths and areas for improvement in my coding skills.

In summary, completing a personal HTML/CSS portfolio site gives me valuable real-world training, helps demonstrate skills I've learned, and serves as a professional asset to jumpstart my web development career. The process of building and maintaining the portfolio will help refine my coding skills through practice.

## Usage

Portfolios act as resum√©s that highlight a coder's specialized expertise in areas like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages. By demonstrating live projects and code samples, coders can provide tangible proof of their abilities.

A coding portfolio is an asset that aids job searches, freelancing, and networking. It establishes credibility for coders as they build their careers. The portfolio also serves as a platform for me to display my style and commitment to the craft through project work.
